            <p> Global average temperature is convenient for detecting and tracking changes in Earth's energy budget—how much sunlight
                Earth absorbs minus how much it radiates to space as heat—over time. It is calculated based on measurements taken at
                different locatons around the globe. This data is then expressed as anomalies: the difference between the temperature 
                observed and the long-term average for each location. Multiple research groups make these measurements and all of them
                show similar trends. </p>

        <span class="explanation">
            <p> The anomalies are less pronounced on ocean surfaces. The reason is the size and enourmous heat capacity of oceans. It
                takes a lot of energy to raise the oceans' surface temperature even by a small amount. That's why even small increases
                (like the 1 degree Celsius increase since the late 19th century) in the global average temperature of oceans is very
                significant in terms of accumulated heat. 
                
            <p> And accumulated heat creates a compounding effect (more on this later - this
                compounding effect and the fact that we don't understand it fully is what should scare us).
                Land surfaces warm a lot faster than most ocean areas. All this extra heat causes regional and seasonal temperature extrems,
                with consequences like reducing snow cover and sea ice (which triggers other things - remember: compounding effect), intensifying 
                rainfalls, changng habtat ranges, annd more.</p>

<    <div class="title">Oh, this is all cyclic! It happened in the past ... except it didn't (though the cycles are real)</div>

        <span class="explanation">
            <p> So, there are three time scales for cyclic climate variations: millenial, century-scale, and decadal (or less). 
                
            <p> <b>Millenial</b>cycles refer to major glacial (cold) and interglacial (warm) periods (10,000 to 100,000 years). They are initiated by changes in
                the orbit of the Earth, which influence where solar radiation is received on the surface. Here is where the compouding effect
                that I mentioned before makes its first appearance: the changes in distribution of solar radiation are not 
                strong enough to cause temperature changes. However, they initiate powerful feedback mechanisms that amplify the slight warming or cooling
                effect. One of them is caused by ice melting at northern latitudes, which means that less sunlight is reflected and more is absorbed by the Earth, 
                causing more warming. 
                A second one is the concentration of atmospheric greenhouse gas (like CO2). The slight warming of the oceans make them release CO2. 
                And it's been proven that more CO2 causes, again, more warming. That's a powerful feedback mechanisms where slight warming leads 
                to more warming, which leads to more warming, and so on. And here's an interesting fact: distinct feedback in CO2 may lag warming or
                cooling caused by orbital changes by as much as 1000 years. In this way, what begins as fairly minor changes in orbit can produce the 
                glacial and interglacial cycles of the last 800,000 years.
                Here's the hypothesis that is scary: the current climate change is causing a similar feedback mechanisms that will trigger a runaway warming 
                effect in modern times that will be extremely difficult to halt or reverse</p>
            
            <p> <b>Century-scale Climate Cycles</b>
                In addition to multi-millennial glacial and interglacial cycles, there are shorter cold-warm cycles that occur on approximately 200 to 1,500 year time 
                scales. The mechanisms that cause these cycles are not completely understood, but are thought to be driven by changes in the sun, along with several 
                corresponding changes such as ocean circulation patterns (Bond et al. 2001, Wanner et al. 2008). The Medieval Warm Period (900-1300 AD) and the Little 
                Ice Age (1450 to 1900 AD) are examples of warm and cold phases in one of these cycles. Some of these cycles, such as the Medieval Warm Period, may be 
                regional, not necessarily reflecting large changes in global averages. Understanding and reconstructing the regional patterns of climate change during
                each of these periods is considered very important in accurately analyzing future regional impacts such as drought patterns (Mann et al. 2009).</p>

            <p> <b>Interannual to Decadal Climate Cycles</b>
                Ocean-atmosphere interactions regularly cause climate cycles on the order of years to decades. One of the most well-known cycles is the El Niño-Southern
                Oscillation (ENSO), an interaction between ocean temperatures and atmospheric patterns (commonly known as El Niño or its opposite effect, La Niña). 
                ENSO events occur every 3 to 7 years, and bring different weather conditions to different parts of the world (NASA 2009). For example, in the U.S., El Niño 
                events can result in a flow of warm dry air into the Northwest, but above average rainfall  in the southeast (NASA 2009).

                Many other cyclical changes due to oceanic and/or atmospheric processes have been described, such as the Pacific Decadal Oscillation (PDO) which occurs in 
                cycles of 25-45 years (Mantua et al. 1997), and the Atlantic Multi-decadal Oscillation (AMO), occurring on approximately 65-85 year cycles (Deser et al. 2010).
                Scientists are studying how each of these reoccurring cycles might interact with the enhanced greenhouse effect. There is some evidence that global warming
                may be intensifying ENSO events (Li et al. 2013).</p>

            <p> <b>Implications</b>
                For more information about natural climate cycles and their implications, see a presentation by paleoecologist Connie Millar.

                Natural climate cycles can help to understand what climate patterns are expected, and how the recent increase in greenhouse gas emissions is causing deviations 
                from these expected patterns. They can offer insight into amplifying effects that may intensify warming as greenhouse gas concentrations rise (Wolff 2011). 
                They may also provide insight on regional impacts of climate change, which will be veryimportant for developing adaptation strategies for human and ecological 
                communities. However, it is important to recognize that current rates of global climate change are extremely rapid compared to past changes (IPCC 2013 Ch.5),
                and may produce conditions that have not been anticipated.</p>

               <!-- You know what didn't happen before? Humans ... and the rate at which CO2 is being pumped into the atmosphere. And the 
                scary part is that we don't know what will really happen, but we do know with high degree of certainty that there is 
                a compouding effect  
                
                Yeah, it'll all probably cool down again, but will we be there to see it? Will we have to endure catastrophes because of our
                actions (you know that Karma exists, right?)-->
